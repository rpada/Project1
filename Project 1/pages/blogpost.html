              <!--Grinch Monologue from https://ninjamonkeyspy.livejournal.com/585154.html-->
              Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
              Was singing without any presents at all!
              <br>
              He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming! It came!
              Somehow or other, it came just the same!
              <br>
              And the Grinch, with his grinch feet ice-cold in the snow,
              Stood puzzling and puzzling. 
              <br>
            <blockquote id = "quotegrinch">"How could it be so?
              It came without ribbons! It came without tags!
              It came without packages, boxes, or bags!"
            </blockquote>
            <p id ="grinchmonologue">
              He puzzled and puzzed till his puzzler was sore.
              Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before.
              <br>
              Maybe Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store.
              Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more!
              <br>
              And what happened then? Well, in Whoville they say
              That the Grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day!
              <br>
              And then the true meaning of Christmas came through,
              And the Grinch found the strength of ten Grinches, plus two!
              <br>
              And now that his heart didn't feel quite so tight,
              He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light
              <br>
              With a smile to his soul, he descended Mount Crumpet
              Cheerily blowing "Who! Who!" on his trumpet.
              <br>
              He road into Whoville. He brought back their toys.
              He brought back their floof to the Who girls and boys.
              <br>
              He brought back their snoof and their tringlers and fuzzles,
              Brought back their pantookas, their dafflers and wuzzles.
              <br>
              He brought everything back, all the food for the feast!
              And he, he himself, the Grinch carved the roast beast!
              <br>
              Welcome Christmas. Bring your cheer,
              Cheer to all Whos, far and near.
              <br>
              Christmas Day is in our grasp
              So long as we have hands to grasp.
              <br>
              Christmas Day will always be
              Just as long as we have we
              <br><u>
              Welcome Christmas while we stand
              Heart to heart and hand in hand.</u>
